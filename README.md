# Navigation System
This project involves implementaing iterative requirements from creating base software to collect the information to the database of the Navigation system.
Implementation involves creating UML design and implementing the program structure based on the Design.

# First Iteration:
The core system is developed with basic manipulations with the input data. In runtime we can add the information about waypoints and Point of interests. The user can enter the information about a Location along with its Latitude and Longitude which will return the distance between two locations as query


# Second Iteration:
There is an improved design in adding the overall structure of the Navigation system.
A persistance data base is added to the system. This means , A data that is added to the database from the first execution of system does stay. Data can be read and re-written into the system. 

# Third Iteration:
With much improved design, In this iteration, system can identify a faulty database file stored in a JSON format. Systematic unit testing of the system is done using C++ unit test suite.
